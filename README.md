*Project Description:*
Valorant is a 5v5 tactical FPS. One team has an objective to plant the spike and the other team must stop them from planting on certain sites or defuse the spike before it explodes. A team wins by winning 13 rounds first, and a game can go into overtime if both teams reach 12 rounds. An overtime is won by a team winning consecutive attack and defense rounds (win by 2).

In the competitive scene, there are many teams competing in Riot-sponsored competitions, the biggest one being Valorant Champions Tour, which has three main events a year: Master 1, Masters 2, and Champions. At these three events, the top teams from each region compete to crown an international winner.

We aim to use match statistics from previous matches from the competitive scene to predict whether a team will win a future match versus another one. This is helpful for predicting whether a team will win a tournament or not, and helps the user bet on the right team to win.  

*Match Statistics Used:*
 * ACS - Average Combat Score measures
 * ADR - Average Damage per Round
 * KAST - Kills, Assists, Survive %, Trades
 * K/D ratio - Number of kills divided by number of deaths
 * maybe agent classes

*How-to-Launch Instructions:*
