to-do:
- find database that is pullable
- sort by team... calculating the average statistics for each team
- compare each match statistic in each team with that of the other team
- we find the team with the higher statistics

must have:
- make it interactive for the player
  - aka "press 1 or 2 for a map"
- include some variability/risk

for aesthetics:
- GUI
- processing
- import image and reveal team logo slowly

storyline:
- you have a gambling problem and you are kidnapped so you are forced to pay your debts.
- however, your kidnapper offered you one last chance as you cannot afford the debt and
  would have to sell your organs. Your lifeline is this project that will help you bet
  more wisely to pay off the debt.
- if you choose not to listen, you would die
- if you make the right decisions you return home debt-free :D

outline:
- a welcoming message -- player is told they have been kidnapped and is forced to \
  bet with opponent []
- player has aid [] and a certain amount of money
-

for each match:
- who's gonna win the game?
  - if so, how many rounds will they


(when given a high probability of a team winning, player should bet more money)
