to-do:
- find database that is pullable
- sort by team... calculating the average statistics for each team
- compare each match statistic in each team with that of the other team
- we find the team with the higher statistics

must have:
- make it interactive for the player
  - aka "press 1 or 2 for a map"
- include some variability/risk

for aesthetics:
- GUI
- processing
- import image and reveal team logo slowly

storyline:
- you are kidnapped and forced to participate in a betting ring with opponent []
- you, luckily, have the aid of [], which utilizes database to predict which team
  will win the match such that you can correctly predict the victor
- you start with a certain amount of money and have to bet in each match
- if you win, you are able to escape with more $ and freedom
- if you lose, you are sucked into the game (maybe implement processing here)

outline:
- a welcoming message -- player is told they have been kidnapped and is forced to \
  bet with opponent []
- player has aid [] and a certain amount of money
-

for each match:
- who's gonna win the game?
  - if so, how many rounds will they 


(when given a high probability of a team winning, player should bet more money)
